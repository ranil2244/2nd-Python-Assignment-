# Exercise 1
# Name your file: MonthNames.py
# Write a program that reads an integer value between 1 and 12 from the user and prints output the corresponding month of the year.
# An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user)
# Enter the month: 3
# Month 3 is March

# month = int(input("Enter the number"))
# months = [ "January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June","July", "August", "September", "October",
#            "November", "December"]
# if 1 <= month <= 12:
#     print(f"Month {month} is {months[month - 1]}")
# else:
#     print("Invalid month number!")

# Exercise 2
#
# A certain cinema currently sells tickets for a full price of 6 pounds, but always sells tickets for half price to people who are less than 16 years old, and for a third of the price for people who are 60 years old or more.
# An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed in by the user)
# Enter your age: 63
# Your ticket costs £2.00
#
# age = int(input("Enter the age"))
# if age<16:
#     print("Price is £3")
# elif age>=60:
#     print("Price is £2")
# else:
#     print("Price is £6")
